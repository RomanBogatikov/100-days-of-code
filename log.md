# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 19: July 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Read "You Don't Know JavaScript", chapter on Generators. I spent time trying to style Loading Ring with Styled-Components in my CarReseller project, but I just couldn't do it, it works with regular CSS, but not with Styled-Components.

**Thoughts:**
I understand the basics of generators, but not sure how to use them in real life.

### Day 18: July 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Animated couple of components in my CarReseller project using styled-components and @keyframes, but couldn't animate a LoadinRing's 'circle' for some reason

**Thoughts:**
That was a little frustrating that I spent quite a bit of time on @keyframes animations in styled-components and couldn't make one of them work

### Day 17: July 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I continued reading Styled-Components documentation and styled the rest of the components from my CarReseller project with styled-components. I still need to get my @keyframes animations working.

**Thoughts:**
I ran into one interesting moment when I was reading styled-components documentation: state in one of the classes was defined without constructor. That's why I had to read again about classes in JavaScript and static methods (along with 'static' keyword).

### Day 16: July 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I read SASS and React Styled Components documentation. I styled one of components in my CarReseller with styled components. I also read about CORS.

**Thoughts:**
I took a quiz mentioned in frontendmasters today [JavaScript Web Quiz](http://davidshariff.com/js-quiz/) and my score was well above average, though I feel that I could have done better. I am also happy that I am on day 16 already and haven't missed a single day, and I really enjoy the process.

### Day 15: July 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Brushed up my CarReseller project (added loading ring, optimized code, added some components). I also finished Google tutorials on Promises and Fetch API).

**Thoughts:**
I need to dedicate a bit more time to CS fundamentals (Algorithms and Data Structures)

### Day 14: July 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on my CarReseller project, cleaned up my code, added code to display a loading ring in the future (now only words 'Loading...' show up)

**Thoughts:**
I like that feeling that I code daily and keep track of my progress

### Day 13: July 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I'm on a camping trip and have no wi-fi. But I still coded and managed to style the image that I couldn't do yesterday.

**Thoughts:**
I am happy that without googling I still was able to style the image the way I wanted.

### Day 12: July 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Watched CS50's React Native lectures and added some CSS to my CarSeller project (struggled a lot with CSS and wasn't able to implement what I wanted). I went camping with my family today but still managed to spend time to code (and find a spot with Wi-Fi).

**Thoughts:**
I definitely need to spend more time polishing my CSS skills.

### Day 11: July 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I finished the 'Service Workies' game today. I added code to register service worker to my Farm Game project, and I am able to put and retrieve data from cache storage.

**Thoughts:**
I like when my code works :)

### Day 10: July 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent a lot of tyme reading You Don't Know Javascript series (Chapter 5. Grammar - from Types And Grammar book), revising what I learnt yesterday about Service Workers and studying some more. I coded along the way and thought about how I can use Service Worker inside some of the apps I had already built.

**Thoughts:**
It was quite a productive day, though I didn't work a lot on my projects.

### Day 9: June 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I investigated the concept of tracking pixels and how they work, wrote a function that determines if the tracking pixel is visible on the viewport (it was part of an application for a job). I also finished 2 out of 3 chapters in the Geddski & Google Developers "Service Workies" game.

**Thoughts:**
I feel like I don't have enough time to learn what I have planned to learn (prepare for Google Mobile Web Specialist certification, learn React Native, study CS basics, improve my CSS). Medium-level challenges from Hackerrank take a lot of time and I can't always find the best solution and some test cases timeout, that means my algorithm is not good enough, though correct. Anyway, I enjoy web development and dedicate time to studying it, and I am getting better.

### Day 8: June 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I have finally deployed my CarReseller project to Heroku using Node.js server proxy and was able to seed cars in the database. Everything works!

**Thoughts:**
Though I feel like it took me too long to set up server proxy and make the database work, I still accomplished this. I still feel I will struggle when I build my next project using proxy, but I will definitely struggle less.

### Day 7: June 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I literally spent 1 hour today updating my previous Cycle Heaven project. I used shouldComponentUpdate to avoid unnecessary rerendering. I couldn't use PureComponent because there were two properties in the state, and one of them was changing (to display loading ring). So shallow comparison that PureComponent uses always rerendered it.

**Thoughts:**
I spent almost my whole day with my son playing on the beach. I still dedicated 1 hour to build something new. I shouldn't feel bad about not spending enough time coding today, my son also wants my attention.

### Day 6: June 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time trying to deploy the project I did yesterday, but it didn't work. Also spent some time playing around with form validation using foundation

**Thoughts:**
I didn't spent as much time coding as I wanted today. I might set aside deploying the project, because I spend too much time on it. I'd better continue my Google Mobile Web Specialist certification courses, spend more time with CSS and start learning React Native.

### Day 5: June 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent about 4 hours on Hackerrank intermediate challenge and about 3 hours trying to understand how to deploy Create-React-App with ExpressJS and MongoDB using proxy, but neither worked

**Thoughts:**
I spent a lot of time today on both Hackerrank challenge and deployment, but my Hackerrank solution is not optimal (it is correct, at least) and doesn't get all the points due to timeout. And I still don't understand how to deploy my CRA with proxy... Well I just need to spend more time on this.

### Day 4: June 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent all day working on a project for a potential employer

**Thoughts:**
Learned about React PureComponent to prevent re-rendering, refreshed my Express and MongoDB knowledge. Have to spend some time to figure out how to incorporate server-side code into create react app and what are pros and cons.

### Day 3: June 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: finished 4 Hackerrank problems from Linked Lists section

**Thoughts:** Hackerrank challenges took more time than expected, basically my whole day. But I managed to also redeploy my [Farm Game](https://github.com/RomanBogatikov/farm_game) personal project to Heroku (instead of Github pages) to be able to try to supplement it with a Service Worker.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
